  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Poppins
       fonts:
         - asset: custom_fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
         - asset: custom_fonts/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
           weight: 600
         - asset: custom_fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf
           weight: 700
